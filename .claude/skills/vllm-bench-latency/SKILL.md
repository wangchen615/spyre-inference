# Latency benchmark on Spyre

Run `vllm bench latency` for a model the user names against **this** `spyre-inference` checkout and report the numbers; optionally re-run the identical benchmark on `main` for a side-by-side comparison. Assumes you are already on the Spyre host, in the repo, with the package installed editable (`uv sync`) — like the other skills here. It does not provision hosts, sync code, or manage credentials.

## Hard constraints (do not violate)

- **Single accelerator, sequential only.** Spyre serves one process at a time — never run two Spyre-backed commands concurrently (no backgrounding, no `pytest -n`). In `--compare-main` mode the two runs are strictly sequential.
- **Profiler-free `torch-spyre` only.** A wheel built with `USE_SPYRE_PROFILER=1` carries the instrumentation into every run and inflates latency substantially. Those numbers are not comparable to a normal build and must not be reported as latency — verify in preflight and stop if the profiler is linked.
- **`uv run --no-sync`** is mandatory — a plain `uv run` / `uv sync` re-resolves the lockfile and clobbers the editable install.
- **`SPYRE_NUM_CPUS=8` on every leg.** Unpinned threading oversubscribes the box and the numbers wander run to run, so legs are no longer comparable. Use `SPYRE_NUM_CPUS`, not `OMP_NUM_THREADS`: the platform's `configure_threading` overwrites all five threading vars (`OMP_`/`OPENBLAS_`/`MKL_`/`NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS`, `VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS`) from the detected core count at startup, and `SPYRE_NUM_CPUS` is the input to that detection — so it is the one knob that lands, and it pins all five. Export it for *both* legs of a comparison, never one.
- **No unexpected compile inside the measured window.** Graph recording is expensive per shape, and far more so at runtime than at warmup, so a single leaked recompile swamps any real delta. Pre-cover the shapes (step 0b) and verify with the compile-leak gate (step 3) before reporting any mean.
- **Non-destructive.** The `main` comparison uses a throwaway `git worktree` + a temporary editable-install repoint — never `git checkout` / `git stash` in the working copy, and always restore (step 2).
- **Always report, never invent.** End every run with numbers from the JSON (step 3); if a run fails, report the failure with the log tail instead of a number.

## Inputs

- **`<model>`** (required): HF model id or locally-cached path. If omitted, default to `ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct` and say so in the report.
- **`--compare-main`**: after the current-branch run, run the **identical** benchmark on local `main` and print a comparison. Only when the user asks to compare.
- Benchmark params (optional; defaults in parens): `--input-len` (64), `--output-len` (64), `--batch-size` (1), `--max-model-len` (128), `--num-iters` (10), `--num-iters-warmup` (2).
- **`--enforce-eager`**: benchmark the uncompiled path. Only pass it if the user asks — compiled (`STOCK_TORCH_COMPILE`) is the platform default.

## Steps

### 0. Preflight

```bash
test -d .venv || { echo "no .venv — run 'uv sync' first"; exit 1; }
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD); SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
echo "spyre-inference: $BRANCH ($SHA)"

SO=$(find .venv/lib/python*/site-packages/torch_spyre -maxdepth 1 -name '_C*.so' | head -1)
test -f "$SO" || { echo "no torch_spyre/_C.so — cannot rule out a profiler build"; exit 1; }
if ldd "$SO" | grep -q libaiupti; then
  echo "torch-spyre built with USE_SPYRE_PROFILER=1 — latency inflated, do not benchmark"; exit 1
fi

export SPYRE_NUM_CPUS=8   # required on every leg — see Hard constraints
```

### 0b. Pin the compiled shapes

Two independent things trigger graph recording, and both must be settled *before* the timed window.

**Token count** — the platform builds one graph per entry in `compile_sizes`. The default is **already sparse**: powers of two from 1 up to `--max-num-seqs`, plus one prefill bucket at `min(max_num_batched_tokens, 512)` (`platform.py` `apply_config_platform_defaults`). Overriding it pays off only when the benchmark runs *fewer* concurrent sequences than `--max-num-seqs` allows (a serving default of 256 gives 10 buckets; `--max-concurrency 4` needs 4), or to pin the ladder so a later `--max-num-seqs` / `--max-model-len` change cannot move it. **Read the real ladder before assuming there is anything to trim** — it is printed verbatim in the `core.py:121 Initializing a V1 LLM engine ... with config:` dump (one enormous line; grep it for `compile_sizes`). The `Warming up model with <N> bucket sizes` line gives only the count, min and max.

```bash
# Decode steps schedule exactly (number of running requests) tokens, so cover
# 1..batch-size; prefill chunks fill the batched-token budget. Keep 512
# (torch-spyre's max shape) as the largest entry: platform.py sets
# max_num_batched_tokens = max(compile_sizes), so a smaller max silently
# reshapes scheduling instead of just cutting compile time.
CSIZES='[1,2,4,512]'   # at bs=4/512 this IS the default -- pins it, saves nothing
```

Derive the list from the config, don't copy it. `bs=1`, `in64/out64/max128`: decode schedules 1 token, the prompt prefills in one chunk, so `[1,64]` is the complete cover — and a max of 64 is safe here precisely because 64 already holds the whole prompt. `bs=4` with a 3200-token prompt: decode schedules 1–4, prefill chunks fill the budget, so `[1,2,4,512]` (`find_bucket` pads 3 up to 4).

**KV block count** — the per-block mask tile list grows by one entry every time `kv_len` crosses a `block_size` boundary (128, the platform default), and `compile_sizes` does *not* bucket that. Each crossing is a fresh runtime re-record — the expensive kind. Choose params so the block count is **constant across the timed window**:

- make `--input-len` a multiple of 128, and
- keep `--input-len + --output-len` inside the *same* block, i.e. `output-len ≤ 128`.

`in3200/out128` works: 3200 = 25×128, so all 128 decode steps sit inside block 26. A long `--output-len` at high `--max-model-len` is the pathological case — `out3072` crosses 24 boundaries, and compilation then dominates wall clock.

Also pass `--no-enable-prefix-caching`: with it on, timed iterations hit the cache the warmup iterations filled, so `num_computed_tokens` differs, the prefill chunks come out a different size, and that new shape re-records *inside* the measured window.

**Warm the shape you measure.** `--num-iters-warmup ≥ 2` for `bench latency`. `bench serve` needs no warmup requests: attention kernels are recorded during server warmup, so no request pays per-shape compile.

Report `Warmup complete in <N>s for <M> buckets` from the log so the compile saving is visible.

### 1. Run the benchmark (current branch)

Fix the params in one block so a compare run is identical, then run and read back the JSON (source of truth):

```bash
MODEL="<model>"; INPUT_LEN=64; OUTPUT_LEN=64; BATCH_SIZE=1
MAX_LEN=128; ITERS=10; WARMUP=2; EAGER=""   # EAGER="--enforce-eager" only if asked
TAG=branch
OUT=.claude/skills/vllm-bench-latency/logs; mkdir -p "$OUT"   # artifacts live here, not the repo root
export SPYRE_NUM_CPUS=8

uv run --no-sync vllm bench latency \
  --model "$MODEL" \
  --input-len $INPUT_LEN --output-len $OUTPUT_LEN --batch-size $BATCH_SIZE \
  --num-iters-warmup $WARMUP --num-iters $ITERS --max-model-len $MAX_LEN \
  -cc.compile_sizes="$CSIZES" --no-enable-prefix-caching \
  $EAGER \
  --output-json "$OUT/latency_${TAG}.json" 2>&1 | tee "$OUT/latency_${TAG}.log"
cat "$OUT/latency_${TAG}.json"
```

The JSON has `avg_latency` (s), `latencies` (per-iter), `percentiles` (keys 10/25/50/75/90/99). First run is slow (cold compile); `FallbackWarning` lines are normal. On error, report the tail of `$OUT/latency_${TAG}.log`, not a fake number.

### 2. Compare against `main` (only if `--compare-main`)

If the current branch already **is** `main`, skip and say so. Otherwise benchmark `main` via a throwaway worktree — repoint the editable install at it, run the **identical** command, then **always** restore (even on failure) so the env is left as found:

```bash
WT=$(mktemp -d); git worktree add --detach "$WT" main
MAIN_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short main)
uv pip install --no-deps -e "$WT"            # repoint editable install at main

TAG=main
export SPYRE_NUM_CPUS=8
uv run --no-sync vllm bench latency \
  --model "$MODEL" \
  --input-len $INPUT_LEN --output-len $OUTPUT_LEN --batch-size $BATCH_SIZE \
  --num-iters-warmup $WARMUP --num-iters $ITERS --max-model-len $MAX_LEN \
  -cc.compile_sizes="$CSIZES" --no-enable-prefix-caching \
  $EAGER \
  --output-json "$OUT/latency_${TAG}.json" 2>&1 | tee "$OUT/latency_${TAG}.log"
cat "$OUT/latency_${TAG}.json"

uv pip install --no-deps -e .                # restore editable install
git worktree remove --force "$WT"
```

The comparison is **current working copy (`$BRANCH` @ `$SHA`, incl. uncommitted changes) vs local `main` @ `$MAIN_SHA`**. For origin/main, the user should `git fetch` and re-run.

### 3. Report

**Compile-leak gate first.** Any mean is only meaningful if no graph recording happened inside the timed window. Check before quoting one:

```bash
python - <<'EOF'
import json
d = json.load(open("<OUT>/latency_<TAG>.json"))
L = d["latencies"]; r = max(L)/min(L)
print(f"spread max/min = {r:.2f}  {'LEAK' if r > 1.1 else 'clean'}")
EOF
```

For a `bench serve` leg the equivalent test is `Mean ITL / Median ITL > ~1.1` (a mean several times its median is a stall, not a slow model). If the gate trips: report **median only**, say explicitly that mean latency / TTFT / TPOT / E2EL are compile-contaminated and therefore invalid, and do not compute a % delta from them. The absolute compile cost is also asymmetric between legs (one leg warms shapes the other reuses), so a mean-based delta can invert the true sign.

Then report the model + exact params, and numbers from the JSON:

- **Single run**: avg latency + p50/p90/p99 (s). Optionally decode throughput = `output-len × batch-size / avg_latency` tok/s (decode only — ignores prefill).
- **Compare mode**: a small table (branch vs main) of avg latency + key percentiles, the absolute and % change (`(branch − main) / main × 100`), and which is faster. Label each column with its branch/sha.

```text
model: <model>   params: in<N>/out<N>/bs<N>/max<N>/iters<N>/warmup<N>/<compiled|eager>
                        main (<sha>)   <branch> (<sha>)   Δ
avg latency (s)         <a>            <b>                <b−a>  (<pct>%, <faster/slower>)
p50 (s)                 <a>            <b>                <b−a>
p90 (s)                 <a>            <b>                <b−a>
```

## Notes & pitfalls

- **First run is slow.** A cold cache forces a recompile even with a shared cache PVC, so the cold compile can take many minutes — *most of it during the first warmup iteration*. The `Fast Path Debug] SUCCESS` spam is per-decode-shape compilation and keeps going well after `Warming up...` prints, so reaching warmup is **not** "almost done"; don't promise an ETA while those lines still emit. In `--compare-main` mode the `main` leg often compiles cheaper (reuses the shapes the first leg warmed) — so compile cost doesn't explain latency deltas; those live in the timed iters.
- **The profiler is on by default.** torch-spyre's `setup.py` reads `USE_SPYRE_PROFILER` with a default of `"1"`; with it on, `setup.py` compiles the profiler sources and appends `aiupti` to `LIBRARIES`. This repo pins it off via `[tool.uv.extra-build-variables.torch-spyre]` in `pyproject.toml`, so a wheel built through this checkout is clean — but a hand-built wheel, or one from a tree missing that block, has the instrumentation in. That block was dropped in #500 and restored in #525, so wheels from that window are also suspect.
- **Judging a profiler build.** Because a profiler build must link `aiupti`, `ldd` on `torch_spyre/_C.so` is conclusive: no `libaiupti` means profiler-free (`nm -CD "$SO" | grep -i aiupti` should also be empty). Two things that look like signals but are not — wheel size, since `_C.so` has grown enough that a profiler-free build now matches the size `docs/user_guide/kineto_profiling.md` attributes to a profiler build; and `torch_spyre.profiler.is_available()`, hardcoded to `False` regardless of build flags. Treat that doc's detection section as stale generally.
- **No compile env vars.** `--enforce-eager` is the only compile *switch*, and `-cc.compile_sizes` (step 0b) the only compile *tuning* — it is required, not optional. `SPYRE_FORCE_COMPILE_ATTN`, `-cc.mode` and a bumped `VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` show up in older logs and notes here — those are stale; do not copy them forward. A raised `VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` in particular papers over a leaked recompile instead of fixing it; fix the shape coverage.
- **`find_bucket` pads up; its `None` path is normally unreachable.** The platform pins `max_num_batched_tokens = max(compile_sizes)`, so the scheduler cannot emit more tokens than the largest bucket and a bucket is always found. Should something raise the budget after that hook, the failure mode is: a total-token count with no bucket ≥ it runs the forward pass unpadded, which Dynamo-recompiles mid-request and usually ends in `TimeoutError: RPC call to execute_model timed out` (preceded by `No available shared memory broadcast block found in 60 seconds`) and `EngineDeadError`. So `[1,2,4,512]` covers every decode step at batch ≤ 4 (3 pads to 4), but a *mixed* prefill+decode step like `{reqA: 128, reqB: 1}` = 129 tokens is only safe because 512 is in the list.
- **Grow context by decoding, not by prompting.** A prompt longer than `max_num_batched_tokens` gets chunk-prefilled, and with concurrency > 1 the scheduler emits mixed batches whose shapes warmup never saw. Keep the prompt within one batched-token budget where possible, and never exceed `--max-num-seqs` with `--max-concurrency` — over-admission causes preemption/recompute, which shows up as a P99 ITL orders of magnitude above the median.
- **Compile isn't universally safe.** Granite and llama are fine, but some models crash *natively* at warmup under compile (gemma-class here). If warmup dies natively rather than raising a Python error, retry with `--enforce-eager` before calling it a regression, and label the result as eager.
- **Model not cached**: an uncached HF model downloads on first use (extra minutes); a locally-cached id skips that.
- **Metrics scope**: this reports *only* whole-generation latency (`avg_latency`, `latencies`, `percentiles`, all in seconds) — each iter is one opaque `llm.generate()` over the batch. There is **no** TTFT / ITL / TPOT / per-token breakdown and no throughput in the JSON (derive it as above). If the user wants TTFT or ITL/TPOT, that's `vllm bench serve` (needs a live `vllm serve` server) — say so rather than faking it from this run.
