"""Model-specific Spyre adaptations, per architecture.

Every architecture ``spyre_models()`` names is replaced by a subclass that lives
in the matching module here; ``_``-prefixed modules hold machinery shared between
them. Registration is lazy: nothing is imported until vLLM resolves the
architecture, so an architecture this deployment never serves costs nothing.
