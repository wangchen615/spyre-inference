"""DeviceCommunicator override for IBM Spyre devices.

The currently-installed `libspyre_comms.so` only has `barrier`, `broadcast`,
single-tensor `allgather(Tensor&,Tensor&)`, and pairwise `send`/`recv`
actually implemented. The list-form `allgather`, `allreduce`, `gather`,
and `reduce` overrides on `SpyreCommsContext` are throw-stubs. The
`_allgather_base` entry point on the torch-spyre side is also stubbed
regardless of the comms lib.

That means the base `DeviceCommunicatorBase` collectives that route through
`dist.all_reduce`, `dist.all_gather_into_tensor`, `dist.all_gather` (list),
and `dist.gather` will all throw at runtime when the device_group's backend
is `spyreccl`.

This class supplies a hand-rolled fallback for `all_reduce` that works for
TP=2 by using send/recv + broadcast (all of which ARE implemented), so the
TP forward path can run end-to-end on two ranks without waiting for the
upstream comms-side implementations to land. Other collectives raise a
clear NotImplementedError describing what's needed to unblock them.

REPLACE-WITH-NATIVE markers below identify each fallback that should be
removed once libspyre_comms gains the corresponding native impl. The
intent is that when the comms library catches up, this whole file can
be deleted (or reduced to a couple of overrides for ops we genuinely
want to do differently for perf), and the platform's
`get_device_communicator_cls` can revert to the base class.

Per-op blockers:
  - all_reduce        : libspyre_comms native allreduce.
  - gather            : libspyre_comms native gather.
  - all_gather (list) : libspyre_comms list-form allgather. The single-
                        tensor `allgather(Tensor&,Tensor&)` IS implemented
                        in libspyre_comms but is not exposed via
                        torch-spyre's spyreccl backend.
  - reduce            : libspyre_comms native reduce. Not on the standard
                        TP forward path; we don't need it for #137.

The companion test file `tests/test_spyre_comms_native_probes.py` runs
each native collective on a real spyreccl device_group and is xfail-strict.
When a comms RPM lands an impl, the corresponding probe flips to passing,
the strict-xfail fails CI, and that's the signal to delete the override
here.
