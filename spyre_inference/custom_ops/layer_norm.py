"""Spyre-safe ``torch.nn.LayerNorm`` replacement.

``torch.nn.LayerNorm`` is plain PyTorch, not a vLLM ``CustomOp`` (unlike
``RMSNorm``), so it can't be intercepted via ``register_oot``. Its default
forward goes through ``aten.layer_norm.default``, which torch-spyre decomposes
into three native ops (``exx2`` -> ``layernormscale`` -> ``layernormnorm``,
see ``torch_spyre._inductor.decompositions.spyre_layer_norm``). That
decomposition is wrapped in an ``_OPWrapper`` that unconditionally
``torch.compile``s it in isolation the first time it's dispatched eagerly --
regardless of ``--enforce-eager``. For call sites outside any per-block
compiled region (e.g. CLIP's ``pre_layrnorm``/``post_layernorm``), the
resulting fused kernel fails at the native ``dxp_standalone`` compiler stage
("Not enough dimensions" matching ``layernormnorm.ddl``'s fixed 5-dim
signature).

Fix: ``SpyreLayerNorm`` reimplements the forward pass with plain
mean/var/rsqrt arithmetic, so ``aten.layer_norm.default`` (and its crashing
decomposition) is never invoked at all. The mean/var reduction accumulates in
fp32 -- unlike fp16, which overflows to ``inf`` once ``|x - mean| > 256`` and
silently zeroes the row via ``rsqrt(inf)`` -- matching what ``F.layer_norm``
itself does internally, and needed here because CLIP's boundary norms are
exactly where activation outliers of that magnitude show up.

This is a drop-in subclass, not a global monkeypatch of
``torch.nn.LayerNorm`` -- only the specific boundary LayerNorms that actually
hit the crash (currently: CLIP's, patched in ``spyre_inference.multimodal.clip``)
should be swapped to it. Most ``LayerNorm`` call sites live inside a per-block
``torch.compile`` region and never take the crashing eager path in the first
place, so patching them too would be unnecessary blast radius onto unrelated
models.
