"""Spyre-specific Conv2d implementation (Pixtral/Ministral vision patch embed).

vLLM lowers a patch conv to im2col + GEMM, whose on-device reshape produces a
sub-stick `copy_from_d2d` expression torch-spyre cannot lay out for patch grids
coprime with the 64-wide stick. So run the real `F.conv2d` on-card instead, with
the weight and input placed into explicit `SpyreTensorLayout`s. Layout tuples are
derived from shapes, so any out-channel count and image size work.
